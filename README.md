## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to deepen my understanding of power control, battery management, motor control, and peripheral integration within an electric vehicle system. I plan to begin with a stripped-down frame from a dirt bike or mini bike, which will serve as a foundation for the projects construction. This frame will provide basic mechanical componenets such as steering control, wheels, and suspension.

I will mount an electric drive motor to the bike frame to power the bike via a chain-drive sprocket. To support and power this motor I will design and implement a battery pack with an Appropiate BMS to ensure safe operation. The motor will be controlled by an ESC which will response to an integrate twist throttle.

Beyond the drivetrain I plan to implement several peripheral systems to enhance safety, functionality, and complexity. These peripheral systems include mirrors, front and rear lighting, and a LCD screen display. This display will show importand information related to the health and status of the overall system. Information on this display will likely include speed readings, battery status, and temperature readings from both the motor and the battery.


## Educational Value Added

This project represents a significant opportunit for personal and technical growth particularly in the ares of power electronics, embedded system control, peripheral integration, and fabrication. I view this undertaking as something that will challenge me to learn more at each step, but be quite acheiveable for me. The process of designing, testing, and implementing these systems will give me a new way to approach problems in my engineering career as well as practice in action making and honing these systems to the absolute best of my ability and beyond. This project will require research and exploration into the topics of electric motor control and management; battery cell design, construction, management, and implementation; alongside the main drivetrain I plan to implement an array of peripherals that will require me to design the system to accomodate several different components; to bring this entire idea together, I will have to touch up again and expand my horizons of fabrication and metalworking. I have already learned a lot doing simple preliminary research on these topics and feel very excited to work in a project-based enviroment on something I am passionate about while being in such a productive space with a like-minded community.
